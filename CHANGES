Version 0.1a (9/24/09): Will begin logging changes after I get a successful URL returned

Version 0.1a(10/3/09): pUpload() now parses cUpload()'s returned XML, and returns the image URL

Version 0.1a(10/4/09): When pUpload() is called now, it will return a dict containing all of the parsed XML, if the response is OK

Version 0.1a(10/5/09): cUpload() now sends a URL directly to imgur.com instead of downloading the image to a /tmp/ file, then uploading it.

Version 0.1b(10/7/09): Now includes imgur_install.py, which is a temporary quick installer for when I develop this.
