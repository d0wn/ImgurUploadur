Version 0.1a (9/24/09): Will begin logging changes after I get a successful URL returned

Version 0.1a(10/3/09): pUpload() now parses cUpload()'s returned XML, and returns the image URL

Version 0.1a(10/4/09): When pUpload() is called now, it will return a dict containing all of the parsed XML, if the response is OK
